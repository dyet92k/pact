# Pact

The original Pact library was written in and for Ruby, at realestate.com.au in 2013. Since then, the Pact family has grown to include many other languages. The Ruby Pact implementation has now moved to be with the rest of its kin in the [pact-foundation](https://github.com/pact-foundation). You can find the new repository [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby).

Thanks to REA for being the birthplace of Pact!
